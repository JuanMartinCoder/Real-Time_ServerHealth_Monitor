## Techonologies Used
- Go
- Gorilla Websocket

2. in the repo folder do go run .
3. Go to localhost:1313/ to view your system's data
   

### Future Ideas
- In case of horizontal scaling, be able to monitor each server and load
- Connect this to a database and obtain server's load data to analyze trend
